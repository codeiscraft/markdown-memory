# markdown memory

`markdown memory` is not _yet another_ application for writing in markdown.

Rather, it's an application that acknowledges that the act of _review_ and _reflection_ on your markdown is different than the act of writing.

## goals

- self hosted; all notes stored only temporarily in local cache via full end to end encryption.
- view synced notes in a read-only, themed UI with a focus on readability and simplicity.
- define sets of notes via various means (tagging, text search, properties), which can be viewed in a themeable, read-only UI.
- define criteria for synced sets like "on this day in the past", "on a specific date", "last 50 entries", "random note".
- track frequency and streaks for a wide variety of content within markdown.
- rich customization in styling and layout for specific types of markdown notes in your collection.
